## Deprecated

I'm not maintaining this anymore, as I've evolved as a programmer and now
use a different approach for C++ projects; I will delete the repository in
a few months since writing this.  
If you want me to keep it up or you want
its ownership, send me an email or something.

# Modular C++

This is a simple template for modular C++ projects.  
Documentation will be added in the near future.

Feel free to delete README.md, this is just a markdown file to fill the
Github main page and doesn't really concern the template at all.
